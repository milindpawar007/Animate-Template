## `TITLE` & `PAGE` :mag:
**ANIMATED-TEMPLATE** - A Template project for making great landing pages with animations

## `WHAT` is the `MOTIVATION` behind this project? :bulb:
:telescope: The modern web is now based on components. Every webpage/webapp we come across are build with components. Some common examples are menu bar, search bar, navigation bar, share-ability to common social media platforms etc. Of course some of these components needs to be hooked up to bankend services to perform the desired tasks — thats another thing, but to re-create these components from scratch would be very tedious and time consuming.

Enter [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A Utility first CSS Framework for rapidly building custom designs -- Where we leverage the power of pre-built components to make out webpages/webapps. :white_check_mark: 

Then we take it one notch higher — even the basic webpages (i.e landing page, profile page, shopping card page) have the same properties/functionalities these days — So why not leverage the power of pre built Template pages :interrobang:

Enter [Creative Tim and their free Tailwind starter kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation). I found some components for popular front-end frameworks like React/Angular/Vue etc  -- that can potentially be connected to a backend service to update those components. :link:

Lessons? - Don’t reinvent the Wheel! Build around it!! :rocket:


## `WHAT` is this project `ABOUT`? :clipboard:
This project demonstrates the ideas behind creating **Reuseable UI Components** which can potentially be hooked up to a backend webservice for dynamically generating/displaying the information in the Components

## `HOW` is this project `IMPLEMENTED`? :gear: 
This project is implemented with the following steps
* Download the ***starter kit*** from the ***creative tim*** site.
* Find the html for the ***landing page*** -> get playful and try to get hang of how things are here (everything is foms and cards!)
* Comment on the HTML doc for better understanding
* Modify the local assets with some cloud asset pictures from the ***Unsplash Page***
* Get Random user pics from ***RandomUser*** for the headshot/display pictures
* Impleted ***AOS(Animate On Scroll)*** animation library for scroll based animations (the CDN for AOS is implemented here)
* Get ***PLAYFUL!!!***

## `WHAT` are some of the possible future `ENHANCEMENT` ideas for this project? :nut_and_bolt:
* Try to optimize the Animations for better UX
* Download the REACT/ANGULAR/VUE components from Creative tim, hook it up to a backend webservice for the possible features
* Change the UI animations with your assets to make it your own!
* Make it more responsive/accessible for mobile devices.
* Enhance the performance of the page
